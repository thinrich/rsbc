These are the three files that will be needed to gather our data.

TO INSTALL

Step one: 
  Get as many apps as possible into a directory (we will call it the root directory) 
    EX:
    cd path/to/root/
    ls
    birthday redmine some_other_app  ... 

Step two: Install all the apps (I think this will be the hardest part, when I get back I will start working on a script that will attempt to do this
  and flag the failures. Then I suppose I will work through as many failures as I can to try and get them running)

Step three: we need a script that will go into each app directory and...
  - copy divvy.rake to each application/lib/tasks
  - copy rsbc_helper.rb (birthdates_helper.rb renamed) to application/app/helpers 
  - run $> rake rsbc_translate
  (this sets up the rails environment, grabs all models and runs them all through our translator which logs information about them)

Setp four: After all the log files are created we can run piecharts.rb which must be placed in the root directory containing all the applications.
  This will parse all the log files and report statistics to the console.
