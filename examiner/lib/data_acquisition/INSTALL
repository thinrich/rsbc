TO INSTALL

1. Get as many apps as possible into a directory (we will call it the root directory) 
    EX:
    cd path/to/apps/
    ls
    birthday redmine some_other_app  ... 

2. Install all the apps via bundle install 

3. copy files into apps
  - copy divvy.rake to each application/lib/tasks
  - copy rsbc_helper.rb (birthdates_helper.rb renamed) to application/app/helpers 

4. Run rake db:migrate

5. Run rake rsbc  # Generates the log files 

6. ruby piecharts.rb
