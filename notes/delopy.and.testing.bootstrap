Possible route:

Use what mike has. 

create a rake task to:
  
  1) Grab all models with custom validations, pass it to the translator

  2) Take JS generated by Plato, wrap it with custome validation for client_side_validations
    a) issues with this are
      i) must have proper field names for the validators or else validator won't know what fields to check. If `f.input :month, as: 'different name'` is done, we'd have to somehow reference that field, maybe id: 'some-id' could be forced for each input

  3) Some how execute the js in the context of the webpage, and test validators, checking for true and false when we expect true or false. 
    a) possible paths: therubyracer, run this all on the serverside, execute the JS in context with ruby to test js validators. some sort of script that opens the page, submits data, and depending on some indicator will report successful translation or not
