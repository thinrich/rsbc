Mikes additions / changes to BirthdatesHelper.rb

X Changed ruby_error_sink so that it doesn't look for '<<' operator since it is possible that we will need to translate this 
   for some other case, instead the method now looks for :errors recursively

X mimic_server_side_validation Now takes just a model, and runs a loop creating a new validation js for each method that the model uses to validate.
	One drawback that I'm not sure how to approach is that there is a lot of js created (A whole new file for every method) just "window dressing" at this point
	but something to think about. Maybe we could consodlidate somehow.

+ Added get_validations(model)  - Takes a model and uses the callback chain to grab all the validation methods defined in external validators
	and within the model itself. Returns an array of unboundMethods to be used in mimic_server_side_validations

+ Added parseBlock(sexp) - Allows more than one statement to be used in the validation method 

+ sexp_logger - writes error log messeges to path/to/rails/log/rsbc.log  This will work for any rails app (I think).

+ Additions to ruby2kif
	- :self => used in validation methods defined in the model itself
	- :ivar => Instance Variables :: At this point we are just treating these as regular variables (lvar) we will see how long we can get away with it!
